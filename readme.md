# Foosball Backbone Frontend

## Description
This marks the second month of my *12 Months of Code*. First month was the 
Flask backend. Now it's time to create a front-end! The Javascript front-end
will be organized using Backbone. The client will communicate with the server 
through a JSON interface.
